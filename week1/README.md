    Before you start the first TA session you should have installed Python 3, in particular Python 3.5 or 3.6, on your computer.
    We use python 3.6 but for Windows you should use Python 3.5 if you do not want issues with TensorFlow later.
    You also need jupyter to view jupyter notebooks that contain the exercise descriptions.

    We recommend using  <a href="https://www.continuum.io/downloads"> Anaconda </a> for an easy way to install Python 3
    which should include and all the Python packages we use in the course including jupyter.

    You are of course welcome to just install python 3 with your favorite package manager and use pip to install packages.

    For developing and testing code we recommend  <a href="http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/"> IPython </a>.
    <br>You can also use more fancy IDEs like PyCharm of Spyder depending on your own preferences of course.
    </p>
    <p>We have set up a web server for temporary Jupyter Notebooks. 
    They are deleted automatically after 1 hour of inactivity, so do not use this to save your important work. 
    The server is available when you're connected to eduroam at AU on bussen.cs.au.dk, but you cannot access it from home.
    But it is probably easier to run the notebooks from your own computer.

    For a quick intro to python see <a href="../../guides/AboutPython.ipynb"> Short Intro to Python and Numpy </a>
    <br>You can also just start by downloading the exercises and look up help when you need it.
    Start with the theoretical exercise: Math Quiz in Python
