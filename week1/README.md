# Week 1 Exercises 
Before you start the first TA session you should have installed Python 3, in particular Python 3.6, on your computer.
You should be able to use python 3.5 or 3.7 without issues as well if you prefer.
You also need jupyter to view jupyter notebooks that contain the exercise descriptions.

We recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) for an easy way to install Python 3.
This should include or allow you to install all the Python libraries we use in the course including jupyter.

You are of course welcome to just install python 3 whichever way you like and for instance use pip to install and manage packages.
    
For developing and testing code we recommend  [Ipython](http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

You can also use more fancy IDEs like PyCharm of Spyder depending on your own preferences of course.
    
For a quick intro to python see [Short Intro to Python and Numpy](AboutPython.ipynb).
If you are new to python you should really read and understand this first. 

Now get started with the exercises (download the notebooks to work with them).
Start with the theoretical exercise:

[Math Quiz in Python](theory_mathquiz.ipynb)

The coding exercise is not easy but give it a try anyways

[Coding Exercise](description_text_classification.ipynb)
