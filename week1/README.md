# Week 1 Exercises 
Before you start the first TA session you should have installed Python 3, in particular Python 3.5 or 3.6, on your computer.
We use python 3.6, but you can use python 3.5 or 3.7 if you wish.
You also need jupyter to view jupyter notebooks that contain the exercise descriptions.

We recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) for an easy way to install Python 3
which should include or allow you yo install all the Python libraries we use in the course including jupyter.

You are of course welcome to just install python 3 with your favorite package manager and use pip to install packages.
    
For developing and testing code we recommend  [Ipython](http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

You can also use more fancy IDEs like PyCharm of Spyder depending on your own preferences of course.
    
For a quick intro to python see [Short Intro to Python and Numpy](AboutPython.ipynb)
If you are new to python you should really read and understand this first. 

Now download the exercises and look up help when you need it.
Start with the theoretical exercise:

[Math Quiz in Python](theory_mathquiz.ipynb)

The coding exercise is not easy but give it a try anyways

[Coding Exercise](description_text_classification.ipynb)
